# Interactive Form
With this project I learnt jQuery and Regular Expressions and applied them to build dynamic interactivity and validation into a HTML registration form. <br><br>
Validation is applied in realtime as user input events are registered.<br><br>
Error messages displayed update in realtime conditionally according to the error (e.g. field is blank, or entry isn't of the write length).<br><br>
This was all coded from scratch: no in-built or automatic validation was used, and no pre-written regexs were used.


## Principles applied
* Progressive Enhancement
* Unobtrusive JavaScript (jQuery): dynamically adding functionality in accordance with principle of Progressive Enhancement
* DRY: spotting repeating patterns and replacing them with functions that accept parameters to deal with variables within the patterns

## Skills demonstrated
* jQuery (for majority of the code), including use of looping over collections of jQuery objects, and methods such as .each()
* Regular Expressions: custom writing these to handle name, email and credit card validation
* DOM selection, traversal, manipulation and insertion
* Event handling - delegation, progagation, use of the Event Object
* Conditional statements, including use of a switch statement
* CSS cosmetics - font-selection, colours
* CSS classes to style error indicators - dynamically toggling these using jQuery
* git / GitHub: full commit history and use of branches to build incremental features, test them then merge back into master
